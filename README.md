# TV Show API Assessment

This is a frontend assessment created by Tamara Eaton as part of the Bounteous React Apprenticeship hiring process. Data is pulled from a provided API and displayed to the user with the following requirements:

- Given a string substr, `getTVShowNames` must perform the following tasks:
    -  Query http://api.tvmaze.com/search/shows?q={substr} (replace substr with your search criterion). 
    - Store each show meeting the search criterion.
    - Sort the shows in ascending order by name.
    - Print to the console the sorted TV show names.
